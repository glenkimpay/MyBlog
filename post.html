                    <p>
I love music in a way words can not express.
The beats are like drugs that make me go through high. 
It is a trip.
It puts me in a state between reality and imagination.
 

Now hell,
I started dancing for real at 21 years old.
I am one of the luckiest girls on earth because I go hard as a motherfucker.

Because music has been my teacher.
The greatest coach for listening.
I have been listening to my own voice.
To my own soul.
 
You know what is the difference between me and you?
I am not just smart you see,
I am wise.
I am a life sergeant.
You guys sacrificing your quality of life for being a dancer that is gonna get you nickels and dimes in the very first years, if not at your entire life.
Unlike you-
I want more,
I'm striving after a degree that will put in my pockets stacks of thousands, so that I could keep on being that woman that doesn't depend on no one for funding classes and workshops in my 30s.
I'll still have my relaxation with a morning coffee,
'cause I won't need to rush for any bus with a Porsche in my garage.

I am gonna use these stacks for a vision I have been building.
And not just a backup dancer for celebrities.
'Cause I am gonna become a celebrity myself.
While y'all would fight for auditions like sardines can on a stage, I would be begged for a solo.
 
I have a blueprint,
So I keep on being patient for I am wise.
I know the virtue of time.
I have been appreciating time my entire life.

You all do your thing without looking at the view.
I do my thing with looking what is beyond it.
 
I am blessed for it.
 
You all don't know me,
You might see me now saying she is a mediocre, or you might not even see me at all.
But I got to where I am 'cause I don't give a fuck what YOU ALL think.
Yes I am angry,
Angry in a good way.
I love this anger .
My power coms from within.
It is not external.
I am deep.
Deep in every level of my body.
Y'all step into class 'cause you want to get a dance job,
I am stepping into a class and sweating way more then you do, and I am not even after a dance job yet.
I am just feeding my soul for now.
 
Yes, i have what you fuckers don't.
My own body language-
which one day you will copy. 

I have my own flow, 
My own style
My own me.
I am crazy.
I am a 1000 Spartans men inside of me.
I am ready to sacrifice everything for 'em.
I am gonna serve them 'til my last day I will be on this earth.
I breath the music while you just let it pass.
And yes...
 
I am hungry,
You don't know how hungry I am to express what I feel when I hear those beats.
I am my own team.

And one day I am going to prove myself that I am that beast.
I am the king of the jungle.
I am gonna prove myself that what is in my head would eventually turn into reality.

I don't need to live in a hood to feel the pain.
I don't need to listen to real gunshots and to witness death of people I care about.
I don't need to be called a Nigga' nor dude nor bro'.
'Cause I feel the music so strong I can become whoever I want.

I am a Denzel Washington in "Training day" and I am Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman".
But what I am the most is Muhammad Ali in the ring.
You don't know what is coming for you.
 
I am the great, and i know it before I could even show it to myself.
But unlike you, I am not in a rush to show it on the external so fast.
'Cause I make it grow from within.
I am going through my own process in the right rhythm,
For music has taught me that.

And this is where true power needs to come from.
So eventually what will be shown on the outside,
will be a SIDE EFFECT.

You all just rookies to know that.
 
SO JUST LET THE MUSIC PLAY,
AND I WILL RUN THE REST OF THE BIZ,
 
 
'Cause I am a woman who stands behind her words-
I promised myself I am not gonna' stop.
And I am gonna make it.
Period.

                    When I came to this world, 
no one told me I was born to make someone happy
satisfy this selfish world
hell with that
I'm gonna' be selfish too
 
no rules apply to me in this world
four values 
and one God
luck is a rolling dice - rolling on every road I walk in
the odds are unclear
but the burden is greater
 
I go hard on life
believe karma does its job
working extra hours
why women love feeling sorry for themselves?
get that stick that is shoved you know where
it is your life
own it
 
I didn't serve as a warrior in a battlefield
but I've been serving as a warrior in life
the kind of combat you don't hear about in the news

my gun is my freedom
the trigger is my decision
my killings are my targets
the funerals are my past
the scars are my reminders
the memories are my strength
the king said once:
"they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out"
 
feels so wrong to go against the grain
so wrong not to follow
the lonely feeling
the need for someone telling it's o.k 
a stiff shoulder to lean on 
sheding tears in front of the sea
so it could understand the feeling
 
it's hard to walk alone 
the world is waiting
but I'm still here
so I dance and write
thinking and orienting
trying to stay on my feet
 
the streets are dressed in warm sweaters
while I want to get undressed
so I can feel the raindrops
consolting my face
 
my gun is my freedom
the trigger is my decision
my killings are my targets
the funerals are my past
the scars are my reminders
the memories are my strength
the king said once:
"they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out"
