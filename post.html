                            Dance is not just a dance. It defines me.

<br>
<br>Dance to express and not to impress is not just a statement,
<br>It is a belief that I follow.
<br>I want to grow stronger in my character, 
<br>To improve my skills not to prove people that I’m strong 
<br>But to prove myself that I can make a difference, 
<br>And I’m doing it because I love to do it. 
<br>
<br>It is a freedom of expression where you can be who you are and nobody can judge you. 
<br>It has different styles based on the person’s preference.
<br>With the different genres to choose from.
<br>Having said all that I believe that no matter how good you are, 
<br>No matter how difficult your choreography is,
<br>
<br>“If you don’t do it with your passion, then it will be just like a food with no taste in it.” 
<br>
<br>It may look good but if you don’t feel the dancer’s heart, 
<br>It’s totally useless.
<br>I’ve met a lot of dancers in the Baguio Dance Community. 
<br>I’ve learned that the most humble persons in the dance community 
<br>Are the ones who actually made started from the bottom up now here.
<br>And the ones that does not, are the ones who fall.

                         Let the music play, I'll take care the rest of the biz
                        </h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>
<br>I love music in a way words can not express.
<br>The beats are like drugs that make me go through high. 
<br>It is a trip.
<br>It puts me in a state between reality and imagination.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Now hell,
<br>I started dancing for real at 21 years old.
<br>I am one of the luckiest girls on earth because I go hard as a motherfucker.
<br>
<br>Because music has been my teacher.
<br>The greatest coach for listening.
<br>I have been listening to my own voice.
<br>To my own soul.
<br> 
<br>You know what is the difference between me and you?
<br>I am not just smart you see,
<br>I am wise.
<br>I am a life sergeant.
<br>You guys sacrificing your quality of life for being a dancer that is gonna get you nickels and dimes in the very first years, if not at your entire life.
<br>Unlike you-
<br>I want more,
<br>I'm striving after a degree that will put in my pockets stacks of thousands, so that I could keep on being that woman that doesn't depend on no one for funding classes and workshops in my 30s.
<br>I'll still have my relaxation with a morning coffee,
<br>'cause I won't need to rush for any bus with a Porsche in my garage.

<br>I am gonna use these stacks for a vision I have been building.
<br>And not just a backup dancer for celebrities.
<br>'Cause I am gonna become a celebrity myself.
<br>While y'all would fight for auditions like sardines can on a stage, I would be begged for a solo.
 
<br>I have a blueprint,
<br>So I keep on being patient for I am wise.
<br>I know the virtue of time.
<br>I have been appreciating time my entire life.

<br>You all do your thing without looking at the view.
<br>I do my thing with looking what is beyond it.
 
<br>I am blessed for it.
 
<br>You all don't know me,
<br>You might see me now saying she is a mediocre, or you might not even see me at all.
<br>But I got to where I am 'cause I don't give a fuck what YOU ALL think.
<br>Yes I am angry,
<br>Angry in a good way.
<br>I love this anger .
<br>My power coms from within.
<br>It is not external.
<br>I am deep.
<br>Deep in every level of my body.
<br>Y'all step into class 'cause you want to get a dance job,
<br>I am stepping into a class and sweating way more then you do, and I am not even after a dance job yet.
<br>I am just feeding my soul for now.
<br> 
<br>Yes, i have what you fuckers don't.
<br>My own body language-
<br>which one day you will copy. 
<br>
<br>I have my own flow, 
<br>My own style
<br>My own me.
<br>I am crazy.
<br>I am a 1000 Spartans men inside of me.
<br>I am ready to sacrifice everything for 'em.
<br>I am gonna serve them 'til my last day I will be on this earth.
<br>I breath the music while you just let it pass.
<br>And yes...
<br>
<br>I am hungry,
<br>You don't know how hungry I am to express what I feel when I hear those beats.
<br>I am my own team.
<br>
<br>And one day I am going to prove myself that I am that beast.
<br>I am the king of the jungle.
<br>I am gonna prove myself that what is in my head would eventually turn into reality.
<br>
<br>I don't need to live in a hood to feel the pain.
<br>I don't need to listen to real gunshots and to witness death of people I care about.
<br>I don't need to be called a Nigga' nor dude nor bro'.
<br>'Cause I feel the music so strong I can become whoever I want.
<br>
<br>I am a Denzel Washington in "Training day" and I am Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman".
<br>But what I am the most is Muhammad Ali in the ring.
<br>You don't know what is coming for you.
<br> 
<br>I am the great, and i know it before I could even show it to myself.
<br>But unlike you, I am not in a rush to show it on the external so fast.
<br>'Cause I make it grow from within.
<br>I am going through my own process in the right rhythm,
<br>For music has taught me that.
<br>
<br>And this is where true power needs to come from.
<br>So eventually what will be shown on the outside,
<br>will be a SIDE EFFECT.
<br>
<br>You all just rookies to know that.
<br> 
<br>SO JUST LET THE MUSIC PLAY,
<br>AND I WILL RUN THE REST OF THE BIZ,
<br> 
<br> 
<br>'Cause I am a woman who stands behind her words-
<br>I promised myself I am not gonna' stop.
<br>And I am gonna make it.
<br>Period.

                    </a>
                    <p>
<br>When I came to this world, 
<br>no one told me I was born to make someone happy
<br>satisfy this selfish world
<br>hell with that
<br>I'm gonna' be selfish too
<br> 
<br>no rules apply to me in this world
<br>four values 
<br>and one God
<br>luck is a rolling dice - rolling on every road I walk in
<br>the odds are unclear
<br>but the burden is greater
<br> 
<br>I go hard on life
<br>believe karma does its job
<br>working extra hours
<br>why women love feeling sorry for themselves?
<br>get that stick that is shoved you know where
<br>it is your life
<br>own it
<br> 
<br>I didn't serve as a warrior in a battlefield
<br>but I've been serving as a warrior in life
<br>the kind of combat you don't hear about in the news
<br>
<br>my gun is my freedom
<br>the trigger is my decision
<br>my killings are my targets
<br>the funerals are my past
<br>the scars are my reminders
<br>the memories are my strength
<br>the king said once:
<br>"they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out"
<br> 
<br>feels so wrong to go against the grain
<br>so wrong not to follow
<br>the lonely feeling
<br>the need for someone telling it's o.k 
<br>a stiff shoulder to lean on 
<br>sheding tears in front of the sea
<br>so it could understand the feeling
<br> 
<br>it's hard to walk alone 
<br>the world is waiting
<br>but I'm still here
<br>so I dance and write
<br>thinking and orienting
<br>trying to stay on my feet
<br> 
<br>the streets are dressed in warm sweaters
<br>while I want to get undressed
<br>so I can feel the raindrops
<br>consolting my face
<br> 
<br>my gun is my freedom
<br>the trigger is my decision
<br>my killings are my targets
<br>the funerals are my past
<br>the scars are my reminders
<br>the memories are my strength
<br>the king said once:
<br>"they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out"

                            "A friend loves at all times and a brother is born for Adversity" - Proverbs 17:17
                        </h3>
                    </a>
<br>You say, you’re not loved and don’t deserve to receive a letter,
<br>I don’t want you to feel that way, I want you to feel better,
<br>Because, not only you are my Bestfriend, you are my Brother,
<br>I’ll try if you want me to write you a million letter,
<br>If that’s what it takes to make you feel better,
<br>
<br>So Brother, when you’re feeling like nobody cares just read this poem, and know that I’ll always be there.
<br>
<br>Whenever you feel sad and that no one is around,
<br>Always know I will be around.
<br>When you think that nobody care
<br>I hope you know that I will always care.
<br>When you feel like no one is by your side
<br>I’ll be there even if the tide is high
<br>
<br>So don’t let me catch you saying, you have no one and that no one is around
<br>
<br>Wake up!! Get out of this haze,
<br>I’ll always be your friend forever and always.
<br>
<br>Remember, You’re special, you’re strong, loving and kind,
<br>Know matter who’s there you’ll speak your mind,
<br>A friend like you is hard to find,
<br>One that touches you deep inside.
<br>You’ve given me strength to carry on,
<br>You’ve offered your hand to hold on,
<br>When times are tough, I know you’re there,
<br>To offer support and show you care.
<br>I not for you I would have drowned,
<br>But you help me keep on solid ground.
<br>I believe you were sent from the man above,
<br>Because he knows the strength of your love.
<br>You show that love in so many ways,
<br>It helps me get through my darkest of days.
<br>So for that I write this poem for you,
<br>And tell you from my heart THANK YOU!!!
<br>Pull this paper out, and read this poem over, and over again,
<br>Because you are my Brother and you are my Bestfriend.
